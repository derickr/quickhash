- Split out option parsing in the php extension to a seperate func for re-use.
- Allow different allocation methods for the backend code.
- Strip out writing/collecting just like I did with loading so that other
  writers (like PHP streams) can be used.
- Check out other hashing algorithms depending on what stats show.
- Look at better ways of reporting more specific errors from the library to the
  extension.
