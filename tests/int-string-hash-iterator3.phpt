--TEST--
Test for iterating over a hash while adding/deleting entries through ArrayAccess.

<?php
$found = 0; $value = 0;
$file = dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/simple.string.hash";

echo "Normal:\n";

--XFAIL--
For now, there is a memleak that I can not find which only occurs when using
the ArrayAccess way of removing an element from the list (with unset()).
